# AndroidHelpers

Android Helpers is a collection of helpful Kotlin extensions as well as classes that I will use repeatedly across my projects.
I will also be adding useful implementations I come across (for example [SingleLiveEvent](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/blob/dev-todo-mvvm-live/todoapp/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/architecture/blueprints/todoapp/SingleLiveEvent.java)).
If something like SingleLiveEvent becomes part of the Android SDK, it will be deprecated in my Android Helpers library as I make the
conversions.
